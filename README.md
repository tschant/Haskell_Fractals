Haskell Fractals
================

This is a project done for KU - EECS 776: Functional Languages.

I created a Haskell application that would generate different type of fractals based on a menu selection.
I am using a library called blank-canvas to draw the fractals to the browser.

The Fractals
================
I wrote the code to create a basic recursive circle drawing/fractal, a tree fractal, 2 types of ferns and a Sierpinski triangle.
The Sierpinski Triangle is not working as it should be, but the general idea of it is written down in code.
